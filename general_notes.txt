lair of lostmauth

lostmauth - huddle in centre at 50%, area floods. stand at corners of central pentagon to
avoid falling rocks


castle ravenloft
---
sisters - 
1 dps keep 1-2 sisters busy with book, 
Make sure to stand behind the boss if you are not the tank, in order to avoid building up stacks of vitae debuff.
When the boss states “Attack me if you dare fools” stop attacking to prevent dying from reflect. The chains occur one minute apart, and come with a sequence: The sister will kick everyone away, drain everyone’s Action Points, and then do the chains voice telegraph and attack. 
Whenever a sister is killed, they enter a phase where the remaining sisters are “gathering their fallen sister’s power.” This is a DPS check and if you fail to kill the fallen sister fast enough, there is a party wipe. at centre of room where first spawn.
tome:
    Right At-Will – Disabling Phrase: A brief stun with quick cooldown.
    Left At-Will – Shocking Reveal: This is the main tool to pull a sister to you. Notice that this is a channeled mechanic, meaning you need to hold the at-will (default on PC left mouse button) to keep the sister aggro’d. You can move while channeling it. This is crucial to move the sister to where you want her.
    Encounter – Deception’s Rebuke: Clears negative effects from players in small area around the tome user.
    Daily – Stunning Revelation: A longer, cone area stun that affects the sisters.

arcolith -
dps attack from rear, but not completely behind. 
When the boss starts spinning, it cannot be damaged until it crashes into one of the four pillars in the room and once you run out of pillars, you automatically fail the fight. when it hits pillar, debuffed so hit it hard then.
dont allow the Arcolith to touch the pillars with his sword except when he is spinning.

Strahd - 
stick together
kidnap phase - one down below, stay alive. rest above, kill doppelgangers.
taunts one player saying “Come then”, don't hit him.
Rondo of the Night: He performs this at 25% HP. Everyone is raised onto a large floating platform, where you then need to use the daily power of the Sunsword, Sundrenched Aegis. You should wait until the sword states “Now, raise me to the heavens” before casting the daily. To make sure the length of the bubble is long enough, it’s recommended to activate it about two seconds after the voice prompt. 


LOMM
---
Arcturia - 
    Butterfly cloud keeps you from using powers; stay out of it.
    Thorns hit 3 times, tank should block at least 2 of them.
    At 80% mimic phase starts. Tank/Heal go to the green corner. Strongest DPS goes to yellow. Place the
other DPS at blue/purple. After the Tank/Heal kill their 1st mimic, they should go help the blue/purple
DPS kill their mimics. If the yellow DPS is ranged they can help blue/purple in the delay they have from
killing their first till their second spawns. If one of the DPS just can't kill a mimic, have then run with
the tank/heal instead. Once 6 mimics are dead the phase ends. 
    Mimic phase repeats every 60 seconds after the first, plus at 50%.
    After each mimic phase a non-healer will be pulled to her feet and cocooned (helpless, dropped to
20% health). The healer has about 5 seconds to get them healed to full. Then the cocoon explodes; if the victim
was not 100% they are permadead, as well as anyone caught in the blast.
    Any golems that spawned during mimic phase should be tanked to keep them off the healer and ignored by the DPS.
    After the 50% mimic phase she will scream, signalling the end of the mimic phases (unless she bugs out).
    After 50% she will use a few abilities--screams cause random warriors to AOE the floor, avoid it.
Eyeball will do a long stun to anyone facing her--look away. She will still cocoon people sometimes, heal/avoid
normally. An AOE arrow will land on someone, group up to share the damage.

Bore Worm -
    For the first 10% or so, just kill the worm. The worm attacks random targets regardless of aggro.
    When the worm spins you can block/dodge it. If you stand too far away the worm will knock you towards it.
    At around 90% the worm will sink into the ground and cause shifting sands. If you get pulled into the
center you will perma-die.
    Boulders will spawn near each player. single hit to destroy, so use fast/dash at-wills to kill them. Every
boulder that reaches the center makes the coming charge phase last longer.
    After the sands stop everyone must gather at the stairs and cluster around the player with arrows on them
to share the AOE hit. Just stand still while the healer keeps you alive, don't try to avoid the red AOE that
knocks you down, stay clustered.
    The healer usually stands outside the red AOE and heals the group, unless they get arrows on themselves.
If someone does die, the only way to rez them is for one person without arrows to rez them while the person
with the arrows moves away with the other two players, otherwise the knockdown will interrupt you.
    When the worm sinks back into the ground, the charge phase is over, and you can resume killing the worm.
Around 40% health the worm will sink down and start another shifting sands.
    Kill boulders without getting pulled into the center again. The tank should try to aggro as many golems
as they can now. After the sands stop shifting it's time to gather at the stairs again.
    The tank should try to keep the golems aggro, and wedge themselves into the corner of the stairs so you
don't get knocked around like crazy. Otherwise stay clustered up and get healed normally.
    After the worm sinks again the phase is over--resume killing the worm--do not kill the golems. When the
worm twirls it will kill any golems nearby, making the worm take more damage. More importantly, if the worm
twirls twice without killing a golem, you will get a new boulder phase with more golems. (Note if your damage
is good enough, you can kill the golems and kill the worm before it triggers another boulder phase.)

Trobriand -
    There are three rings around the area. As Trobriand is injured, the rings start electrifying. If a scaladar
is standing on a ring when it's electrified it wakes up supercharged, and much more dangerous, capable of
one-shotting some DPS. So don't attack Trobriand while Scaladar are spawned.
    During the first phase the tank should block the left-right swipes from Trobriand, and focus on getting
stamina back, while pointing Trobriand at one or more Scaladars. When he does his cone AOE (which everyone
must avoid, even the tank), it will wake up any Scaladar it hits. The DPS kill them while the tank keeps
fighting/blocking/positioning Trobriand. While tanking Trobriand watch carefully for him to do a palm blast--
you must block it, as it can one-shot a tank when unblocked. If Trobriand just stands still doing nothing for 
a long period of time (5-6 seconds) he might be doing a palm blast with no animation (occasional bug), so block.
    After the first set of Scaladar are dead, go full damage mode (use artifacts now) on Trobriand. Around 60% 
the rings will be fully electrified, and then reset to off, spawning 4 more Scaladar. Stop damage on Trobriand.
    At this point the tank will awaken the next 4 Scaladar (at whatever pace you are comfortable with) and the 
DPS will kill them. After they are all dead, back to full damage on Trobriand. Around 30% Trobriand will move 
to the center of the room and start to gain a charge from the tesla coils.
    The party must kill the coils as quickly as possible; the longer you take, the larger the blast will be that 
you must survive. When the last tower dies, everyone stands with the healer, and everyone activates anything that 
helps them survive damage. If you die to the blast you can't be rezzed. Survivors finish killing Trobriand, while 
the tank focuses on blocking Palm Blast (which Trobriand will use more often), which means you usually only block
one (or even none) of the left-right swings to save your stamina for the blast.
    Throughout the fight you will get polarity symbols of + or - over your head, linked to someone else. If you 
have the same symbol, you must stand near each other. If you have opposite symbols you much stand far apart (like 
on opposite sides of the circle, even into the coils). When Trobriand claps his hands you will be either repelled 
apart (same) or pulled together (opposite). If you are too far apart when same you will get a debuff. If you are 
too close together when opposite you will collide, taking a ton of damage and get a debuff. The debuff from 
either pairing (a chain) makes you do less/take more damage, and needs to be cleansed by the healer. Note there 
will also be a white skull debuff--that's what keeps you from rezzing if you die to the blast, and it can't be 
cleansed.

First Boss Morzach -
3 demons will give you their powers to "help" you. You must choose which will help you.
- Ozgannon (left) gives a power that interrupts and hold enemies.
- Zaxumander (middle) gives a power that deals damage and helps with poison
- Urzuuroch (right) gives a power that helps breaking the chains (2 are almost enough to break one chain)

everyone shoyuld take same power. usually Urzuuroch preferred

then choose a path. take the one that stops portals, as it reducxes add during boss fight

for fight, Never stay in front of the boss : it can charge and all of its attacks will cleave and deal damage to everyone it faces.
When the boss launches into the air, stay close to it and don't move : this should be enough to avoid taking damage.
damage dealers destroy the spores when they spawn so that there's not poison everywhere.

Second boss Zaphael -
Tank should circle around the arena while others stay in the middle or at least not too far away so that healing them is easier.
The boss must not face anyone but the tank or people will die. The tank must always be visible from the boss or the boss will target someone else.

phase 1, there will be big red AOEs on the ground that will spawn under everyone's feet. These are deadly, will one-shot you.
At 75/50/25/7%, the boss will teleport to the middle and 2 imps will grab players. Players should be saved from the imps and hide behind pillars. The boss will explode and you won't survive.

phase 2, small small aoe follwing you, like bel. count to 3, move to avoid the damage.
if the boss cannot see you, you will not be targeted by any aoe : as a healer, you can  hide  behind a pillar while healing the tank with aoes. 
healer: Divine Glow is very recommanded to sustain your divinity.

Signals:
Big red signal means just deal a lot of damage but it will disappear.
Little red and following signal means deal damage and create fire are wher it falls. ( important tactic: try roll/dash/dodge to big fire areas between columns when little red signal follow you. If you do this you will have more space to fight).

Third boss Hellfire Engine -
avoid the attacks, and do not break the ground too fast. But the execution is a bit harder and you will need good team efforts to make it. That one cannot be beaten with half of the team dead from the start.

During the whole fight, everyone will be targeted by small aoes like bel. As soon as the aoe is ready to land (it will be fully darker red and you will hear a sound), move or you will die. These aoes break the tiles on which they land, so always make sure to make the aoe hit a single tile. If you move on a destroyed tile, you will die. A tile can sustain 1 hit before breaking. If the whole group is targeted, everyone should regroup on a single tile (preferably one in a corner, which is already damaged). If a single person is targeted, they should move on an undamaged tile, preferably in a corner, so that the arena does not become smaller. The goal is to kill the boss before the arena is destroyed.
Big tip: If all group stay at same floor and fall fire ball same floor that would be better for you because 5 fire ball hitting ground but just one floor turning fire. And becareful when red signal follows you take place quitly if this signal include another floor other floor take damage also.

attacks (they are cyclical) :
    charge : the boss will charge a dps from time to time. Just don't be on the way.
    tiles on fire : from time to time, a single tile will become red and it will burst fire for a second. You'll take big damage.
    successive rows or columns on fire : the whole arena will burst fire row after row or column after column.
    laser : don't stay in front of the boss. 
    lasers : Sometimes boss stop moving and turning around with flame thrower first. And do it after again and again but these times its have laser right and left side at engine. Try to dodge it.
    chain : The tank will be chained and damaged hard for about 3-5s (about once every minute). Spam Bastion of Health like there's no tomorrow, and use Intercession if necessary (it probably will), otherwise your tank will die. To make it easier, before the chain hits, you can protect your tank with artefacts (like the Sigil of the Paladin) and mount powers (like the Armored Griffon). The boss will roar for 3 seconds before the chain lands. 
    adds : at the end of the fight, there will be small monsters that will spawn. they can bump you into destroyed tiles, which would kill you.

As soon as you are capable of avoiding all the attacks, it's really about coordinating with your team. The only tough part is being able to heal the tank on the chain attack.
***
Tip 1st boss - when he flies and throw spikes you can dash below his belly, right into his circle, to avoid the hit.

Tip 2nd boss - dc and ranged dps don't need to chase the boss like melee, they can be at the centre where the summoning circle is and dodge from there the red aoe etc.

Tip 3rd boss - many times when the single circle is spawning, if it's on the healer/tank even if they move on a clean tile in the end the circle is appearing on one/two random dps. Move all to a clean tile to avoid having these "surprise" circles in the middle.
