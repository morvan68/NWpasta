text and help for Neverwinter dungeons

The general_notes.txt file has short notes for beginners on most dungeons and trials. If it's not mentioned there, basically follow the group and kill things!

The other 2 files are for more experienced players, to give you short text snippets that you can paste into chat during a dungeon, so everyone else knows what they're doing (if they read chat...)

Acknowledgements to anybody who's notes I've copied! (mostly from reddit)

### **you can triple click any word in the copy-paste line to select that whole line.**

windows 10 has [this neat feature](https://www.google.com/search?q=windows+10+clipboard&tbm=vid) that allows you to save multiple copied lines of text and paste them when you feel like it, use <kbd>âŠžwin</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd> to access it (windows 10 versions after the october 2018 update).
