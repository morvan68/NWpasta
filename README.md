# NWpasta

text and help for Neverwinter dungeons

this version has 2 files, that gives you short text snippets that you can paste into chat during a dungeon, so everyone knows what they're doing!

I've also added a file giving basic instructions for more complex dungeons (LOMM etc), just so you have an idea what to do if you've not run them before. Acknowledgements to anybody who's notes I've copied! (mostly from reddit)

### **you can triple click any word in the copy-paste line to select that whole line.**

windows 10 has [this neat feature](https://www.google.com/search?q=windows+10+clipboard&tbm=vid) that allows you to save multiple copied lines of text and paste them when you feel like it, use <kbd>âŠžwin</kbd>+<kbd>v</kbd> to access it (windows 10 versions after the october 2018 update).
